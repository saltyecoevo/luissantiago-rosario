I reached a milestone in my career when I graduated with a Masters in Biology from the Inter American University of Puerto Rico and became a Ph.D. student at Louisiana State University under the guidance of Dr. Kyle E. Harms. I've always been interested in the connection between Eco-Evo-Devo,  phenotypic expression, and plasticity. Recently, I've been focusing on how micronutrient availability, especially sodium, affects consumers phenotypic expression and fitness consequences across a variable phytochemical landscape and among trophic levels.

As a biologist who is proudly Puerto Rican, Latino and queer, I hope to inspire the next generation to be open-minded in science and society.
